## OpenHack Portal Differences

In a BYOS OpenHack, the Azure subscriptions are managed completely out of the Opsgility environment. The following outlines the differences you will experience in the Cloud Sandbox/Coach Portal and the attendee portal in a BYOS OpenHack environment.

### Cloud Sandbox (Coach Portal)

The differences you will encounter on the Cloud Sandbox is as a Tech Lead or a Lead PM/Coach:

- You will no longer have the ability to start or end the lab environment. This is because the Azure subscriptions in a BYOS scenario are not controlled by the Cloud Sandbox. 
- You will not have the ability to view view the Azure credentials for the environments. Access to the Azure subscriptions must be managed in the Azure AD tenant you will use for the BYOS environment. 

### Attendee Portal

The difference you will encounter on the Attendee portal is you will not see the **View Lab Environment** tab with your Azure user credentials. Access to the Azure subscription in managed on the Azure AD tenant you will use for the BYOS environent.
